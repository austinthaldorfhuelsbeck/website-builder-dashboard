# Website Builder

This app stores all requisite data for posts, topics, categories, and events within a database, and provides a service to the administrator for interacting with and modifying this data.

The admin dashboard allows admin users to perform API-enabled actions upon the data from within a user-friendly dashboard.

### The current deployment is available [here](https://website-builder-dashboard.vercel.app/).
