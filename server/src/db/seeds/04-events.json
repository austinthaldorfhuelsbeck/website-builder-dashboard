		"content": "<p>Most people feel like they don’t know how to engage another person’s story well. They feel inept, clumsy, overwhelmed, and/or they don’t know what to say and what not to say.</p><p>Join me and Cathy Loerzel, co-founder of The Allender Center, to learn the art and science behind story work.</p><p>It’s one thing to engage your own story; it’s quite another to skillfully engage someone else’s story.</p><p>The good news is that engaging another person’s story is <em>a skill that can be learned</em>. To that end, we have put together a conference that will teach you the principles and tactics of effective story engagement—in other words, how to do it.</p><p>Saturday, May 13, 2023<br/>8 to 4 PST | 9 to 5 MST<br/>10 to 6 CST | 11 to 7 EST</p><p>If you can’t make it on May 13, <u>a video recording of the conference will be available for three months.</u></p><p>This conference is designed for people who want to learn how to engage another person’s story. The other person might be a family member, friend, co-worker, or client. Engaging someone’s story is part art and part science. <strong>It can be learned!</strong> It is not a magical ability that some people have and some people don’t. <p>There are certain principles that apply—principles that can be learned—that’s the science part. And then there are techniques that need to be <em>caught</em> by watching others do it—that’s the art part. In this conference, we will teach the principles and techniques of effective story engagement.</p>",
